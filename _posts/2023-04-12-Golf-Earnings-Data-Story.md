# Recap

As explained in the Part 1: Data Collection blog before this, professional golfers are able to make more money on the PGA Tour than ever before. A golfer's season earnings are dependent on their success-- win more (of the more popular tournaments) and make more money. 

I want to see what factors contirbute most to golfers winning the most money during a season. Is it their driving ability? Or is it more about putting? I will look at the top 50 golfers for the past 5 complete years of the PGA Tour to see how somebody can win the most money. 

For this project, I used PGA Tour data available from ESPN. In the last post, I explained how I scraped the data from ESPN to create the data for the top 50 golfers each year on the PGA Tour for the last 5 full years. 

In this post, I will do some exploratory data analysis on the data we collected.

Besides wins, the variable that has the highest correlation with earnings per year is birdies per round. For those who don't know, a birdie is when you shoot 1-under par on a given hole. In other words, that is a good hole and golfers want the most birdies (or better) as possible. If you can consistently get birdies, you have a shot at making some good bucks throughout the year. You don't have to drive the ball the furthest, you just have to get it on the green and make birdies.

To wrap up, we narrowed it down to birdies as what may help golfers make the most money in a year on the PGA Tour over other attributes such as average driving distance.
