# Recap

For a little context regarding this project, professional golfers are able to make more money on the PGA Tour than ever before. A golfer's season earnings are dependent on their success-- win more (of the more popular tournaments) and make more money. Throughout this project, I wanted to see what factors contirbute most to golfers winning the most money during a season on the PGA Tour.

In parts 1 and 2, I showed how to both scrape and compile the data, and I performed exploratory data analyses, respectively. I looked at the top 50 golfers for the past 5 complete years of the PGA Tour for this project. The data came from ESPN.

# Findings

After performing an analysis on the scraped dataset, I found that besides wins, the variable that has the highest correlation with earnings per year is birdies per round. If a golfer can consistently get birdies, then they have a shot at earning a large amount of money throughout the year.  

(Note: a birdie is when you shoot 1-under par on a given hole. In other words, that is a good hole and golfers want the most birdies as possible.)
