In this post, I showed how to scrape the ESPN site and collect data on the top 50 golfers on the PGA Tour for the last 5 full years. I am particularly interested in what statistics contribute to the most earnings per year on the PGA Tour. In my next post, I will show how exploratory data analysis of this data can help me understand what attributes of one's golf game will help them win the most money on the tour.

You should write a blog post that discusses your project.  Please keep in mind the following:

1. You need to include some information about how you determined that it was ethical / allowable to get the data that you gathered and/or how you implemented good scraping practice.

2. Keep in mind the principles of good blogging (easy to read, images and figures to enhance, relevant and interesting, etc.)

3. Resist the temptation to write a "log" of everything you did and/or went through to gather your data.  Include just enough information so that someone else can learn from what you did and possibly gather similar data

4. Have an introduction that motivates your project choice

5. Have a conclusion that leaves the reader excited for your next blog post where you will do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of your data.

6. Include a link to your GitHub repo
