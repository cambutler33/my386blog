"Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World" by Meredith Broussard is a thought-provoking book that delves into the limitations and biases of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer systems.

One aspect of the book that I particularly enjoyed was the author's use of real-world examples to illustrate how AI can fail in unexpected ways. Broussard's explanations of the limitations of current AI systems, such as their inability to understand context and the impact of biases in data, are clear and accessible to non-technical readers. I also appreciated the author's exploration of the social and ethical implications of relying on AI systems in fields such as criminal justice and healthcare.

However, at times I found the book to be repetitive, with some concepts being explained multiple times throughout the text. Additionally, while the author acknowledges that AI has the potential to be used for good, the overall tone of the book can feel overly pessimistic about the future of AI and its ability to solve complex problems.

Overall, "Artificial Unintelligence" is a valuable and thought-provoking read for anyone who wants to better understand the limitations and flaws of AI, as well as the impact that they can have on society. It addresses issues such as ethics, gender inequality in STEM fields, and classic data science concepts. While the book is accessible enough for non-technical readers, those with a background in computer science or data science may also find it interesting.

Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
